        <h2 id="ans"> <strong>Ans 1.</strong>
            <ul>Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files,
            usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.</ul>
            <ul>Git commands are used to operate various git operations.</ul>

        <h1 id="q"><bold>Q 2.</bold>What is github ?</h1>
        <h2 id="ans"> <strong>Ans 2.</strong>
            <ul>Github is repository (a kind of online folder) where your project is saved along with all it changes tracked.</ul>
            <ul>Github is a kind of cloud service to store the codes and all its modifications with time.</ul>

                        In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in
                         a repository and saves it to your computer.

                        <ul>Whether there is anything to commit, push or pull</ul>

                        included in the next commit (unless we change the configurations).
                        <br/>We need to use the git add command to include the changes of a file(s) into our next commt. 
                        <ul>To add everything at once: use -A (inplace of file_name)</ul>

                        Once we reach a certain point in development, we want to save our changes (maybe after a specific task or issue).
                        <br/>Git commit is like setting a checkpoint in the development process which you can go back to later if needed.
                        <br/>We also need to write a short message to explain what we have developed or changed in the source code.

                        changes to the remote server. Git push uploads your commits to the remote repository.
                        <br/>Important: Git push only uploads changes that are committed.
                        <br/>We also need to write a short message to explain what we have developed or changed in the source code.

                        By using branches, several developers are able to work in parallel on the same project simultaneously.
                        <br/>We can use the git branch command for creating, listing and deleting branches.

                    <td>
                        We use git checkout mostly for switching from one branch to another. We can also use it for checking out files and commits.

                        <br/><br/>The below command creates a new branch in your local (-b stands for branch) and
                        checks the branch out to new right after it has been created.

                    <td>
                        When you've completed development in your branch and everything works fine, the final step is merging the branch with the 
                        parent branch (dev or master). This is done with the git merge command.
                        <br/>It's important to remember that you first need to be on the specific branch that you want to merge with your feature branch.
                        <br/>For example, when you want to merge your feature branch into the dev branch: First you should switch to the dev branch:
